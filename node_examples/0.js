/*
Explanation of Execution:
Synchronous code runs first:
console.log("Start") runs.
setTimeout() callbacks are registered, but they donâ€™t execute immediately.
Promise resolutions (Promise.resolve().then()) are registered as microtasks, 
to be handled after the current tick.
console.log("End") runs.
Microtask Queue (Promise Resolutions):

After all the synchronous code is executed, the event loop checks the microtask queue 
(before moving to the Timers Phase).
Promise resolutions (Promise 1 and Promise 2) are processed in the microtask queue.
Timers Phase:

After microtasks are processed, the event loop moves to the Timers Phase.
Both setTimeout() callbacks (registered with 0ms) are added to the callback queue, 
and they are executed in order (Timeout 1, Timeout 2).
